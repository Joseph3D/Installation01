Hi, and thanks for purchasing and installing the ProCore Bundle! Your support ensures we can continue developing and supporting all the ProCore tools.

Installing:
To keep updates simple and download size small, each tool is included here as a seperate package. Simply double click and then import each package to install.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1) Please, please backup your ENTIRE project before updating any tool or asset, ProCore or otherwise.

2) Take a few moments to watch each tool's intro video, and maybe even skim the documentation- you'll thank yourself later...and so will we ;)

3) Found a bug or issue? Feel free to contact us anytime, links are right below.
